Array
========

This assignment was an introduction to Arrays.
I learned that the JavaScript array object is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects.
Create an Array var fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana']; console. ...
Access (index into) an Array item var first = fruits[0]; // Apple var last = fruits[fruits. ...
Loop over an Array fruits.
