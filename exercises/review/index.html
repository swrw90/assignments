AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
A way to use javascript to get json data asynchronously (happening at the same time).

GET request --> Server --> "Database" --> Back to server as HTML page?

Servers job was to take data and build an html page then send it back to the client. 

This proces is called Server-Side Rendering. 

Ajax allows for more efficient Client-Side Rendering
During the GET request it begins building the html page. 
When it reaches the Server the server reaches to the database and send back JSON data to the client. 
Then the HTML page renders the data.

GET request does not have to wait for a response from the server in order to continue running the js.
