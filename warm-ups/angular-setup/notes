Module View Controller
Imagine a room, within in the room there's a ball, a camera and a photographer. 
Ball=Module or the data
Camera=View or html, decides to see the data in a certain way
Photographer=Controller decides how to view that data.

Model and view do not communicate, Controller gets data from the model and displays it on the view/html. 

Angular is MVW or MV*
W means w/e, literally, Angular has controllers, services/factories, directives, filters.
Many tools to decide how it's displayed.
