Block vs Inline
=================
This exercise was an introduction to the difference between block elements and inline elements. Inline Elements are elements that only contain other inline elements. Ther do not typically begin with a new line. Other names for inline elements are 'text-level elements' or 'phrase elements'.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements are usually either "block-level" elements or "inline" elements. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block."
